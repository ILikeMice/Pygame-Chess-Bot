# Pygame Chess Bot

As the name suggests, this is a chess bot written using pygame. It uses Stockfish and a python library for it.

For now, you can only play as black (Will add a choice later on).  At the beginning of the python file, you can choose to set the computers rating, although this isn't recommended as it slows the game. During the game, there will be a red square on the fields you click to indicate your selection.

At the end of each game, the program will quit and a FEN will be sent to the command line.

Theres currently not much to the program,except it being able to play chess.

You need to install stockfish from the official website to run this.
